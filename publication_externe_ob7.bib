Tropical tuna purse seine fisheries contribute to this problem via the construction and deployment of thousands of man-made drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs) annually, many of which end up beaching in coastal areas. Here, we analyzed approximately 40 000 dFAD trajectories in the Indian Ocean (IO) and 12 000 dFAD trajectories in the Atlantic Ocean (AO) deployed over the decade 2008-2017 to identify where and when beachings occur. We find that there is tremendous promise for reducing beaching events by prohibiting deployments in areas most likely to lead to a beaching. For example, our results indicate that around 40\% of beachings can be prevented if deployments are prohibited in areas in the south of 8\textdegree S latitude, the Somali zone in winter, and the western Maldives in summer for the IO, and in an elongated strip of areas adjacent to the western African coast for the AO. In both oceans, the riskiest areas for beaching are not coincident with areas of high dFAD deployment activity, suggesting that these closures could be implemented with relatively minimal impact to fisheries. Furthermore, the existence of clear hotspots for beaching likelihood and the high rates of putative recovery of dFAD buoys by small-scale fishers in some areas suggests that early warning systems and dFAD recovery programs may be effective in areas that cannot be protected via closures if appropriate incentives can be provided to local partners for participating in these programs.},

The CPUE time series were treated by fishing mode: free school (FSC) sets and sets associated with floating objects (FOBs).  CPUE for FSC was defined as the catch per hour of large yellowfin tuna ({$>$} 10 kg) since FSC sets are mainly dominated by adult fishes. For FOBs sets, CPUE was defined as the catch per positive set of small yellowfin tuna ({$<$} 10 kg) \textendash{} a positive set defined as a set with small yellowfin catches {$>$} 0 - since mainly juveniles are caught under FOBs. The time series considered were 1986-2017 and 2010-2017 for FSC and FOB, respectively. The two time-series are of different length due to the availability of covariates that likely affect them. In both cases, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was applied for model selection. The resulting time series of standardised CPUE for FSC and FOBs do not show significant trends. Environmental variables were shown to affect catchability.},

  abstract = {Fisheries observer programs represent the most reliable way to collect data on fisheries bycatch. However, their limited coverage leads to important data gaps that preclude bycatch mitigation at the basin scale. Habitat models developed from available fisheries observer programs offer a potential solution to fill these gaps. We focus on tropical tuna purse seine fisheries (TTPSF) that span across the tropics and extensively rely on floating objects (FOBs) for catching tuna schools, leading to the bycatch of other species associated with these objects. Bycatch under floating objects is dominated by five species, including the vulnerable silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis and four bony fishes (oceanic triggerfish Canthidermis maculata, rainbow runner Elagatis bipinnulata, wahoo Acanthocybium solandri, and dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus). Our objective was to predict possible bycatch hotspots associated with FOBs for these five species across two tropical oceans. We used bycatch data collected from observer programs onboard purse seiners in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. We developed a generalized additive model per species and per ocean relating bycatch to a set of environmental covariates (depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, surface salinity, total kinetic energy and the density of floating objects) and temporal covariates (year and month). We extrapolated modeled relationships across each ocean within the range of environmental covariates associated with the bycatch data and derived quarterly predictions. We then detected bycatch hotspots as the 90th percentiles of predictions. In the Atlantic Ocean, bycatch hotspots were predicted throughout tropical and subtropical waters with little overlap between species. By contrast in the Indian Ocean, major overlapping hotspots were predicted in the Arabian Sea throughout most of the year for four species, including the silky shark. Our modeling approach provides a new analytical way to fill data gaps in fisheries bycatch. Even with the lack of evaluation inherent to extrapolations, our modeling effort represents the first step to assist bycatch mitigation in TTPSF and is applicable beyond these fisheries.},

  abstract  = {The abundance of tuna, an important top predator that ranges throughout tropical and subtropical oceans, is now largely determined by fishing activity. Fishing activity, in turn, is determined by the interaction of fish availability, fishing capacity, fishing costs and global markets for tuna products. In the face of overfishing, the continued sustainable supply of tuna is likely to require improved global governance, that would benefit from modeling frameworks capable of integrating market forces with the availability of fish in order to consider alternative future projections. Here we describe such a modeling framework, in which we develop several simple, contrasting scenarios for the development of the tuna supply chain in order to illustrate the utility of the approach for global evaluation of management strategies for tuna and other complex, stock-structured fisheries. The model includes multiple national and multi-national fishing fleets, canneries and fresh/frozen markets, and connects these to global consumers using a network of flows. The model is calibrated using recent data on fish catch, cannery and fresh/frozen production, and consumption. Scenarios explore the control on future outcomes in the global tuna fishery by representing, in a simple way, the effects of (1) climate change, (2) changes in the global demand for tuna, and (3) changes in the access to fishing grounds (marine reserves). The results emphasize the potential importance of increasing demand in provoking a global collapse, and suggest that controlling tuna production by limiting technical efficiency is a potential countermeasure. Finally we discuss the outcomes in terms of potential extensions of the scenario approach allowed by this global network model of the tuna supply chain.},

  abstract   = {Fishing on floating objects (FOBs) dominates catch in tropical tuna purse seine fisheries. One frequently cited advantage of deploying GPS-monitored FOBs is that the position information can be used for directed fishing to reduce search time for tuna. However, purse seiners also fish on foreign objects for which position information is not available. It is critical to quantify the prevalence of fishing on GPS-monitored versus unmonitored FOBS in order to understand how they impact fishing effort and catch per unit effort (CPUE). We analyzed French commercial, observer, and FOB trajectory data in the Atlantic and Indian oceans to determine how often purse seine vessels fish on GPS-monitored FOBs. Only 2.7-20.4\% of French FOB fishing sets over 2007-2013 in both oceans were made on GPS-monitored FOBs. Though increasing over time, the low percentage suggests that French vessels do not primarily use GPS-monitored FOBs to reduce search time for tuna. We hypothesize that fishery-wide FOB deployments have important collective consequences for overall fishing effort, and recommend that future effort metrics should be based on fishery-wide FOB activities.},

  abstract = {Numerous pelagic species are known to associate with floating objects (FOBs), including tropical tunas. Purse seiners use this behaviour to facilitate the capture of tropical tunas by deploying artificial drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs). One major recent change has been the integration of echosounders in satellite-tracked GPS buoys attached to FOBs, allowing fishers to remotely estimate fishable biomass. Understanding the effects of this new technology on catch of the three main tuna species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares; bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus; and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis) is important to accurately correct for this change in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used for stock assessments. We analysed catch data from the French purse seine fleet for the period 2010\textendash 2017 in the Indian Ocean to assess the impact of this fleet's switch to echosounder buoys around 2012. Results indicate that echosounders do not increase the probability a set will be succesful, but they have a positive effect on catch per set, with catches on average increasing by {$\approx$}2-2.5 tonnes per set ({$\approx$}10\%) when made on the vessel's own dFADs equipped with an echosounder buoy. Increases were due to a decrease in sets below {$\approx$}25 tonnes and an increase in those greater than {$\approx$}25 tonnes, with a non-linear transition around this threshold. This increase explains the considerable investment of purse seiners in echosounder buoys, but also raises concerns about bias in stock size estimates based on CPUE if we do not correct for this fishing efficiency increase.},

  abstract = {This study addresses novel questions on the dynamics of tuna aggregations around floating objects, using echosounder buoys data collected throughout the drifts of newly deployed Drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (DFADs) in the Atlantic Ocean (AO) and Indian Ocean (IO). Time series of presence/absence of tunas were obtained by supervised classification of acoustic data. To avoid biases related to the variability in individual DFAD soak times, a new approach was developed to estimate the average colonization time of new DFADs by tuna aggregations. We showed that tunas colonize DFADs after an average of 16 days in the AO, and 40 days in the IO. Moreover, the analysis indicated that the time span during which tuna aggregations occupy DFADs is driven by a time-independent process with short- and long-term residence modes. On average, DFADs were continuously occupied by tuna aggregations for 6 and 9 days in the IO and AO, respectively. The time between two consecutive aggregations at the same DFAD averaged 9 days in the IO and 5 days in the AO. Throughout their soak time after being colonized, DFADs remained occupied for a larger proportion of time in the AO (63%) than in the IO (45%).},

These fish aggregating devices are generally equipped with echosounder buoys that collect acoustic data on the fish communities that aggregate around them. Using a classification model based on supervised learning algorithms, we were able to translate the acoustic data collected along the trajectories of 393 drifting FADs newly deployed in the Atlantic Ocean into presence or absence of tuna aggregation. Analysis of the resulting time series indicated that drifting FADs are colonized by tuna aggregation over an average of 21 days. The results also revealed, for the first time, that the residence time of a tuna aggregation around a single DFAD is about 9 days and that DFADs spend on average 7 days without tuna. Thus, DFADs appear to be occupied by tuna aggregation about 50 % of their soaking time. These metrics can be affected by seasonal variations.},

  abstract    = {Assessing the accuracy of biomass estimates obtained through echosounder buoys and improving the current algorithms used for estimating the associated biomass is a key step towards the derivation of fisheries-independent abundance indices for tropical tuna. Recent results obtained through supervised learning algorithms on M3I buoys, one of the main buoy models deployed by the French tuna purse- seiners, demonstrate a good accuracy for assessing the presence and absence of tuna under FADs, regardless of the ocean. However, these algorithms (and buoy model) are less accurate in determining the size of tuna aggregations. In this paper we investigated possible ways of improving the classification of tuna aggregation sizes by accounting for the species composition constituting the aggregation. Also, we inspected how environmental variables (sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a) can affect the accuracy of the biomass estimates. Our results demonstrate that accounting for the species composition of tuna aggregation, sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a does not improve significantly the accuracy of biomass estimates with this buoy model.
